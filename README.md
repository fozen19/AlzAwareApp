## üîî Notification & Geofencing Logic

### üíä Medication Reminders
- Medications are scheduled with time slots (morning, afternoon, evening)
- The mobile app uses Android's WorkManager and AlarmManager to schedule local notifications
- When it's time to take a medication, a notification is shown to the patient
- Patients/caregivers can mark medications as taken

### üõ°Ô∏è Geofencing & Safe Zones
- Caregivers set a geofence (center + radius) for each patient
- The mobile app monitors the patient's location in the background
- If the patient leaves the geofenced area, an alert/notification is triggered
- Safe locations can be added (e.g., home, hospital) and visualized on the map

### üì° Real-Time Location Sharing
- Patients' devices periodically send their location to the backend
- Caregivers can view the latest location of each patient on a map
